<h1>changeCSS</h1>
changeCSS allows to literally load any css file from any random CSS framework (like e.g. Bootstrap or Tailwind) and helps changing even big css files easily and user friendly.

<h2>how will it work?</h2>
To achieve this, you have to upload your desired css file. The file gets processed, and a set of fields corresponding to the submitted css file will be generated. 

All values of this fields can be changed easily via a user-friendly interface. The overview generates itself automatically, depending on the content of your css file.

After you applied your desired changes, you can save and download the modified css file. 

Just replace the new css file with the old one in your project, refresh your browser and you should see your freshly updated design.
